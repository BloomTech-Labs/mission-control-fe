    body: `Making really good progress on the prototyping of RC #1 but having some concerns about the technical decisions that were made. 
      They might be catching up with the team. They are unsure on how to architect the back-end with their cool-crazy-aws-tech-option. Talk to @hermoine.
      
      I'm not confidxcent in their ability to progress as rapidly once we get into RC#2 based on the planned scope.
  
      Suggestion: @hermoine is going to work with the team to make scope adjustments to scope of RC#2 and break it up into 2 release canvases.
