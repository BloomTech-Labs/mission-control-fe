Mission Control is a system that provisions, tracks, monitors and controls all of the IT resources (virtual, physical, non-physical and logical) for every product built and maintained by your organization. It allows you to keep tabs on deadlines, team members, costs, and everything you need to push your product across the finish line.

When operating at scale, it's easy to get lost in a sea of information. Mission Control provides the clarity and centralization you need to assess your team's productivity and make executive decisions. Mission Control is a one-stop-shop that allows you to get the information you need and focus on what matters most - execution.


### Key Features

-    Not just for products - we also track your projects, allowing for a top-level view of your organization
-    For admins - the ability to view every single product and project in your organization w/ related KPIs
-    For users - the ability to see the projects that they themselves are attached to, allowing for a seamless and lightweight environment
-    Simple user promotion - admins can promote and demote other users in a snap
-    Sync with your data - simply sign up with your work email address, and your data will sync automatically with your database

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React/Redux

-    React is a fantastic choice for building dynamic, interactive UIs. Mission Control is a complex website with a nested component structure, and has demanding relationships with multiple APIs. React allows us to meet the platform's needs efficiently, and helps keep everything organized behind the scenes.
-    As a manager, you need to be able to access a variety of different views, all of which contain different data. This calls for advanced state management. Redux's elegance, scalability, and inherent opinionated nature is perfect for applications that have advanced state requirements, and abstracts away the mess of local state.
-    React/Redux as a pair is a fantastic combination that not only allows for portable, reusable UI components, but also allows for infinitely scalable state, and the ability to shuttle data around the application seamlessly. It is THE enterprise solution.

### LABS18 - Removed Redux to Initiate Context State Management

-   After reviewing and consolidating; Labs18 felt that Redux was just to much Technical Debt for the scale the project is currently so we decided to work on removing it to utilize Context state management.


#### Sass/SCSS

-    Nested CSS is a must when styling your application. SCSS not only allows us as developers to write CSS quickly, but also creates an intuitive flow for later revisions. Add in variables, mixins, and functions, and CSS (arguably) is elevated to a production level.

#### Material UI

-    Material UI is a fantastic resource for advanced UI components such as popovers, avatars, and tabs. We took advantage of Material UI for a wide variety of components, which greatly sped up up our development time. Material UI also offers a fantastic icon library, which we took advantage of throughout the application.

#### Axios

-    Axios is the industry-standard library for HTTP requests in Javascript. It provides a simple, readable syntax, and also allowed our team to make advanced queries, such as concurrent requests that required parallel resolution. Additionally, this application makes requests to several APIs, one of which is REST, the other of which is GraphQL. Axios provides functionality for both types of requests, all in one library. 

### GraphQL (LABS18)

- GraphQL takes over more functions and that allows for the Cache functionality to take over for watching for changes in state and facilitates a better re-render process

#### React Router

-    Single page applications have special needs, particularly when it comes to routing the user from page-to-page. React router allows for the easy transport of the site's users whilst retaining SPA functionality. And with the new React Router hooks, we can do all of this inside of the functional programming paradigm.

#### Formik/Yup

-    Forms in React are not much fun - they require (at least) local state management, and as the forms scale, that process only gets messier. Formik (with the validation library Yup) abstract away the difficulties of writing forms in React, and allow us to focus on core application functionality.

### OKTA

-   Formik/yup was removed to Implement OKTA token login process.
-   OKTA  is a two way handshake that sends and recieves info to then give back a otoken

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify
-[Labs18 Deployed Front end](https://labs-18.use-mission-control.com/manager/dashboard/)

-[Front end Github](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/mission-control-fe)

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/mission-control-be) built using:

#### Node/Express/Postgres - deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

-    Mission Control uses an external API to manage key business data, so our internal API demands were scaled down. Thus, in the interest of focusing on the user experience, we spun up a lightweight Node/Express API to handle authentication and role management within the site itself.
-    We feel that Postgres is the top choice for relational databases, considering it's stability and scalability. It's also very easy to work with, so working with the database is always quick and easy.
-    The full application is deployed to AWS (Amplify for the FE, Elastic Beanstalk on the BE with an AWS RDS). With the full app bundled together in one suite, dev ops becomes a breeze, and we can take full advantage of all of AWS's various products. 

#### Knex.js

-    Knex allows us to make SQL queries to our database quickly and easily. It integrates seamlessly into Node, and also allows us to seed our database when testing on local environments.

#### Validator and JWT

-    Auth is a tricky subject, but luckily there are plenty of open-source libraries and best-practices out there to learn from. For string validation, we used Validator. This library allows us to sanitize our database and ensure that only clean data touches our application. We used JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to create protected access to our API and provide a resouce for the front end to shield certain views.

# APIs

## Authentication

This API allows users to register + log in to Mission Control. It also assigns users roles (student, manager, admin) that all have varying levels of access on the front end and back end. Admins have the ability to promote/demote other users as well, so the role assignments are variable.

## Product Management API - https://api.use-mission-control.com/, https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/product-management-api

Built with GraphQL and Prisma, the Product Management API is the foundation of Mission Control. It contains products, projects, organizational roles, team members, and KPIs regarding your company's data. It requires a Bearer token for full access, which can be obtained by running `prisma token` in the context of that API's repository. More details on that API can be found at the Github link above, or by contacting Bernie Durfee(https://github.com/berniedurfee).


# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_ROLE_KEY - this is the encryption key for the user's role (determines what dashboard they have access to). Choose a secure key (can be anything you want), and set up as a variable in your local application. The production key can be found in the AWS Amplify application
    *  REACT_APP_MISSION_CONTROL_ENDPOINT - can be found in the AWS Amplify application. This is the authentication API

# Testing

#### Jest

-    Embedded directly into Create React App, Jest provides all the tools one needs to run FE unit AND integration tests. Jest can be thought of as the lens through which an application's tests are viewed and ran. It is a stable base for other testing libraries to build off of.

#### React Testing Library

-    React Testing Library is a fantastic testing resource which was built with one guiding principle in mind - your tests should resemble user behavior as closely as possible. Thus, React Testing Library is DOM-focused, and does not bother with implementation details. Instead, it allowed us to test website behavior, and verify that certain information is displayed when it should be. With React Testing Library, the focus is placed where it should be - the shipped product.
